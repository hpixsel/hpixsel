# 👋 Hi, I’m Kacper Adamus
💻 In my free time I'm building websites and ❤️ LOVE IT

### 📂 My hobbies are:
- Web Development
- UI/UX Design 
- Video Games
- Asian Culture

⌨️ I was always interested in how the tech works behind the scenes. 
That's why I started learning programming, my first contact with it was in C++. 
Some time later I learned HTML and CSS and stayed in web development for the time being, learning new things day by day.

🏫 I am of the opinion that the only thing school can teach you, is how to learn *(and even that is too difficult for them most of the time)*, and the only person who can teach you anything is YOU and YOU only. Other people can give you directions, but it's you who make choices.
